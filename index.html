<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  My name is Kyle Bledsoe, and I am currently a sophomore majoring in physics and secondary education, with a minor in mathematics, at Lewis University. I grew up in Plainfield, Illinois, and live with my parents, my sister Alynn, and my dog Scout. I have a strong interest in STEM and also enjoy film and video games. My favorite movie is Oppenheimer, and my current favorite game is Dead by Daylight.

<h2>Fun-Fact</h2>
<p>
  I’m more of a night-owl than a morning person. I tend to stay up late working on random creative projects, as that’s when my mind feels most clear. Getting up early for class usually requires some sort of caffeinated beverage!
